Full stack social media platform
Tiktik is a video social media platform build with typescript.
It has the following features:-
ðŸ‘‰modern design 
ðŸ‘‰google auth 
ðŸ‘‰the ability to upload publish, share comment on and like the videos filtering by categories 
ðŸ‘‰advanced search functionalities 
ðŸ‘‰profile pages 
ðŸ‘‰suggested accounts 
ðŸ‘‰custom response design 

For this project, I have used: 
ðŸ‘‰advanced react best practices such as 
ïƒ¨	folder and file structure 
ïƒ¨	hooks and refs
ðŸ‘‰advanced next.js best practices such as 
ïƒ¨	file based routing
ïƒ¨	data fetching that allows server side rendering and static generation which makes our websites incredibly optimized

We have also used NEXTJS as a backend endpoint.
For the entire state management of the entire application, we have used a small library called Zustand. We have not used Redux or React Context API instead we have used Zustand.
Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. It has a comfy API based on hooks, and isn't rigid or opinionated.
You can download the library by using the following command in your terminal:
npm i zustand

We integrate Oauth to Log in and Register users using Google.
We manage the entire content of your app using Sanity
Sanity is the unified content platform that will make the making of our entire application possible through sanity. 
ðŸ‘‰Our users will be able to upload new content instantly 
ðŸ‘‰On the go, Sanity allows us to focus on developing the application without having to worry about the content file storage and databases. They'll cover all the work for us and allow us to build scalable and modern video social media applications incredibly easy.
